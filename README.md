# My Favorite Series
My favorite series is **One Piece**, it is an anime series. One Piece follows the journey of **Monkey D. Luffy**, a young pirate with the ambition to become the Pirate King. After eating a *Devil Fruit*, Luffy gains the ability to stretch his body like rubber. With a diverse and colorful crew, the Straw Hat Pirates set sail on the Grand Line, a treacherous ocean filled with dangerous creatures and powerful pirates. Their ultimate goal: to find the legendary treasure, the One Piece, and claim the title of ***Pirate King***.
